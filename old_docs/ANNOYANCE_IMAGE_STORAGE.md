# Annoyance Image Storage Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented image storage for annoyance posts using Supabase Storage, similar to the profile image workflow. This provides proper file management, cleanup, and storage optimization.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Service Extensions (`lib/database.ts`)
- **`uploadAnnoyanceImage(userId, file)`**: Uploads images to the `annoyance-images` bucket
- **`deleteAnnoyanceImage(imageUrl)`**: Removes images from storage when no longer needed

### 2. API Endpoints

#### New: `/api/annoyances/image/route.ts`
- **POST**: Upload annoyance images with validation (5MB limit, image types only)
- **DELETE**: Remove images from storage
- Both endpoints require authentication and include proper error handling

#### Updated: `/api/annoyances/[id]/route.ts`
- **PUT method**: Enhanced to handle image cleanup when images are changed or removed
- **DELETE method**: Enhanced to clean up images when annoyances are deleted

### 3. Frontend Implementation (`app/(tabs)/create/page.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Features:
- **Real file upload**: Replaced placeholder blob URLs with actual Supabase storage
- **Loading states**: Added `isUploadingImage` state for better UX
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
- **Image cleanup**: Proper removal from storage when images are changed/removed
- **Disabled states**: Prevents submission during image upload

#### Key Functions:
- **`handleImageUpload`**: Validates files and uploads to Supabase storage
- **`removeImage`**: Removes images from both UI and storage
- **Enhanced submit button**: Shows proper loading states for upload operations

### 4. Storage Setup (`scripts/009_setup_storage_buckets.sql`)
- Created `annoyance-images` bucket with 5MB file size limit
- Configured RLS policies for secure access control
- Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)

## Key Features

### Security & Validation
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (5MB maximum)
- User authentication required
- RLS policies ensure users can only manage their own images

### Image Lifecycle Management
- **Upload**: Secure upload to Supabase storage
- **Update**: Automatic cleanup of old images when changed
- **Delete**: Complete cleanup when annoyances are deleted
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks if cleanup fails

### User Experience
- Loading spinners during upload
- Real-time feedback and error messages
- Disabled states prevent race conditions
- Immediate UI updates for responsiveness

## Technical Implementation Details

### Storage Organization
- Images stored in `annoyance-images/{userId}-{timestamp}.{ext}` format
- Public access for viewing, authenticated access for modifications
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat

### API Integration
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Token-based authentication throughout

### Frontend State Management
- `isUploadingImage` prevents multiple uploads
- Form validation includes upload state
- Optimistic UI updates with proper error recovery

## Usage Flow

### Creating Annoyances with Images:
1. User selects image file
2. File is validated (type, size)
3. Image uploads to Supabase storage
4. Form includes the storage URL
5. Annoyance is created with image reference

### Editing Annoyances:
1. If image is changed, old image is automatically deleted
2. New image is uploaded and referenced
3. Form submission includes updated image URL

### Deleting Annoyances:
1. Image is deleted from storage
2. Annoyance record is removed from database
3. All related data is cleaned up

## Next Steps
1. Run the SQL script `009_setup_storage_buckets.sql` in your Supabase dashboard
2. Test the image upload functionality in the create/edit forms
3. Verify that images are properly cleaned up when changed or deleted

## Benefits
- **Cost Effective**: Only stores images that are actually used
- **Performance**: Images served from CDN-optimized storage
- **Security**: Proper access control and validation
- **Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
- **User Experience**: Fast uploads with proper feedback
